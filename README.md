# This tool is in currently in development.
## This Tool can be used to convert pt1 images to png and vice-vera.
## This tool can only work for 8bpp, 24bpp and 32bpp images without an alpha channel.
## Change the type to 0 in png.cs before building the project as type 0 is the only one that is working fine.
## This tool doesn't do any actual compression while creating images, it just packs the data in the way that the unpacker can unpack it.
